Features
------------

One of a kind Android budget planning application made possible with OCR technology. Simply take a picture of any receipt and the app will automatically scan the image looking for the parsed total and update your monthly spendings in real time. The app will notify you when you are about to exceed your monthly goals and plots the daily spendings accordingly on a graph to display trends and monthly patterns for visual feedback and extrapolation. Equipped with a user friendly interface and a useful history tab filled with previously scanned receipts you can say good-bye to that bulky wallet stuffed with receipts once and for all. 

Usage
------------

To preview simply download the ZIP through git and import the entire project to your favourite Android IDE. Rememeber to include all the OCR(tess-two) libraries and dependencies
